<h2>NYC Yellow Taxi Estimator</h2>
<p>This Shiny App is meant for estimating the profit of the NYC Yellow Taxis.</p>
<p>For the model to be accurate, all variables need to be calibrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Questions to Answer:</h3>


<li>How much profit do the NYC yellow taxi industry generates</li>
<li>Which is the most important cost? How sensible it is to increases?</li>
<li>Which is the distribution of distances, fares and duration of the trips?</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Data was obtained from:&nbsp;<a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page">https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page</a></p>
<p>Working with 2019 data (Jan-Jun).</p>

<li>Filtered transactions that had duration of more than 2 hrs.</li>
<li>Filtered trips with 'zero' fare.</li>
<li>Filtered transactions that were not paid by Credit Card or Cash.</li>
<li>If driver didn't captured number of passengers I assumed there was only 1 passenger.</li>

<h3>Model Assumptions</h3>
<p>All the main variables are contained in the "Model" section and can be modified by the user in a simulation-like form.</p>

<li>Profit is an estimation of Fare + Extra - costs. Tips in some cases can be included too as a total profit in the system but I decided not to include it for now.</li>
<li>Estimated profit excludes tolls, MTA and improvement fees since the Taxi company transfers its to the State or City.</li>
<li>There is a replacement of the net car cost (purchase price - estimated resale value) so that the Taxi company is able to renew cars.</li>
<li>Cost of Medallion is not included since the basic assumption of the model is that the medallion price doesn't increase/decrease over time.</li>
